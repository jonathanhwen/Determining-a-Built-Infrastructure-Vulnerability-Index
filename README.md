# Determining-a-Built-Infrastructure-Vulnerability-Index
 Vulnerability is the relative measurement of the susceptibility of a community to be harmed by a shock or stress. In determining vulnerability there has been a focus on social factors. Yet, models predicted primarily on social factors may inaccurately represent the 
 vulnerability of the built environment for a given location. The built environment supports the social functions of the community, so it is important to consider vulnerability determinations (Rufat et. al., 2015). The Built Infrastructure Vulnerability Index (BIVI) was 
 created using factors associated with the built environment at the county level, such as number of business establishments, structure age, and broadband access. Comparing heat maps of the BIVI, the Social Vulnerability Index (SoVI), and FEMAâ€™s National Risk Index (NRI), 
 further illustrates the relationship between social vulnerability and the built environment, as well as the contributing drivers. We find evidence that a community may be socially vulnerable, but possess a relatively less vulnerable built environment, and potentially less 
 stress from climate and weather hazards. Because of the wide range of variables the BIVI considers, it can help identify at-risk areas within the United States. By using social and built indices, and examining the historical propensity for disaster events, we can better 
 understand the overall vulnerability of a community. By identifying these factors, resources can be allotted to limit the corresponding risks.
